## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### AI/ML Model Security
- **Model Integrity**: INFINITO generates consciousness models that should not be tampered with
- **Training Data**: Experimental data may contain sensitive information
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor GPU/CPU usage to prevent resource exhaustion attacks

### Code Execution
- **Dynamic Code**: INFINITO uses dynamic neural network generation - review custom configurations
- **File I/O**: The system saves experimental data - ensure proper file permissions
- **Dependencies**: Keep PyTorch and other dependencies updated

### Data Privacy
- **Experimental Results**: May contain patterns that could be considered sensitive
- **System Information**: Hardware and performance data is collected in logs
- **User Configurations**: Custom parameters may reveal research directions

## 🔐 Best Practices

### For Researchers
- Always run INFINITO in isolated environments for sensitive research
- Review experimental data before sharing
- Use version control carefully with large model files
- Monitor resource usage in shared environments

### For Developers
- Validate all input parameters
- Sanitize file paths and names
- Use secure random number generation
- Follow principle of least privilege for file operations

### For System Administrators
- Run in containerized environments when possible
- Monitor GPU memory usage and limits
- Implement proper backup strategies for experimental data
- Keep dependencies updated

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities:
- Performance optimizations
- Feature requests
- Compatibility issues with specific hardware
- Expected high resource usage during consciousness experiments
- Deterministic vs non-deterministic results (this is by design)
