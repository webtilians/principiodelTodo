# Changelog - Infinito Artificial Consciousness System

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [5.1.3] - 2025-10-02 - 📊 Comparative Automation & Batch Tooling

### ✨ Added
- Comparative ON/OFF runner now spins up isolated model instances per condition to eliminate autograd cross-talk.
- Lead/lag analyzer and Φ baseline locker with adaptive safeguards for long-duration experiments.
- Batch runner supports aggregation-only workflows, artifact cleanup switches, and per-run metadata tracking.
- Confidence interval (CI95) statistics and bootstrap-aware summaries exported with aggregated results.

### 🔧 Improved
- Comparative bootstrap pipeline hardened against missing data and baseline drift.
- Cleanup routines remove JSON, checkpoints, and cache artifacts on demand while logging retained assets.
- Aggregation summaries capture delta metrics for ON vs OFF states across large experiment batches.

### ✅ Validation
- Comparative focused smoke run (30 iterations), long-run stability check (120 iterations), and dual cleanup batch smoke runs.
- Automated test suite: `pytest` → 3 passed, 59 skipped.
